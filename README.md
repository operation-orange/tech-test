### Install and Run
Just `npm i` and `npm start` (running Node v10).

### Notes:
- Used create-react-app as a base, then ejected and modified as needed.
- Set up with TypeScript, React, Jest, Enzyme, redux, redux-saga, tslint (as production-ready as I could in my limited time).
- The commit history is a marvellous place to look to see what work I've put into this.
- Most time was needed to set up all of the boilterplate required for the above frameworks/libs. The actual task only took roughly 2-3 hours total.
- I'd like to make more improvements and write more detailed notes but I'm seriously short of time unfortunately.
- NO UNIT TESTS as a result but writing those now.
